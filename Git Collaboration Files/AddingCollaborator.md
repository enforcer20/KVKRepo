# Adding a Collaborator

In order to add a collaborator to a project, you must first have your repository created. If you have not yet created a repository, [this page](https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo/blob/master/Command%20Line%20Terms/cp.md) will help you set one up.


## Steps:

This will all be done from the GitHub UI, not the command line. 

1. Click on the link to your repository. It should look something like this:

    ```https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo```

Note: **jeanshanchik** should be replaced with your GitHub account name and **KVKRepo** with the repository you want to share with your collaborators.

2. Once you are in the repository, look for the "Settings" link all the way to the right of the top header. There should be a gear sign next to it.

3. Click on the link "Collaborators" on the right-hand side.

4. Enter your collaborator's GitHub username. If their account is not public, you will not be able to search for it. Otherwise, you may enter their email address.

5. Click on their username once it pops up, and click the "Add" button.

The user should now be able to push to your repository.

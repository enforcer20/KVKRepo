# Adding a Collaborator

In order to add a collaborator to a project, you must first have your repository created. If you have not yet created a repository, [this page](https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo/blob/master/Command%20Line%20Terms/cp.md) will help you set one up.


## Steps:

This will all be done from the GitHub UI, not the command line. 

1. Click on the link to your repository. It should look something like this:

    ```https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo```

        Note: **jeanshanchik** should be replaced with your GitHub account name and **KVKRepo** with the repository 
	you want to share with your collaborators.

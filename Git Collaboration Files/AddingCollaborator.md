# Adding a Collaborator

In order to add a collaborator to a project, you must first have your repository created. If you have not yet created a repository, [this page](https://github.com/enforcer20/KVKRepo/blob/master/gitFlow/repository.md) will help you set one up.

**What is a collaborator?** A collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner. [Reference](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary)

**What is a contributor?** A contributor is someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator access. [Reference](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-glossary)


## Steps:

This will all be done from the GitHub UI, not the command line. 

1. Click on the link to your repository. It should look something like this:

    ```https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo```

Note: **jeanshanchik** should be replaced with your GitHub account name and **KVKRepo** with the repository you want to share with your collaborators.

2. Once you are in the repository, look for the **"Settings"** link all the way to the right of the top header. There should be a gear sign next to it.

3. Click on the link **"Collaborators"** on the right-hand side.

4. Enter your collaborator's GitHub username. If their account is not public, you will **not** be able to search for it. Otherwise, you may enter their email address.

5. Click on their username once it pops up, and click the **"Add"** button.

The user should now be able to push to your repository.

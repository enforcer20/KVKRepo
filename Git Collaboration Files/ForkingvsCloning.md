# Forking vs. Cloning

Forking and cloning in Github are often confused, as the differences are small but significant with respects to project collaboration. In this tutorial, you will learn the difference between them, how to execute a fork or a clone, and in which situations you should use them


# Forking Explained

Say you've just added a collaborator to your repository. The logical next step would be for that person to start working on the project. However, you've already put a lot of files into the repository and have a working application. You don't know if what the collaborator is doing will work seamlessly with your code. To prevent their code interfering with yours before knowing if it is bug-free, the collaborator can **fork** the repository. 

Essentialy, a fork is a **copy** of a repository, and it allows you or your collaborator(s) to experiment with or make changes to the original project without affecting the main source code. After changes are made, the collaborator can make a pull request to the project-owner so they can either accept or reject your changes.

## How do you fork a repository?

### Steps

1. Click on the link to the original repository.

2. Click on the upper right-hand button that says **"Fork"** and has a little picture of a diverging line.

3. Your fork has been created. You will know you're in your fork when your link looks like this:

```github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo```

And underneath it, it says:

```forked from username/KVKrepo```

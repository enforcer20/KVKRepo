# Pull Requests

What is a pull request? Let's suppose you've just forked a repository and you've gone ahead and added a feature or made some changes. If you need a refresher on forking, take a look [here](https://github.com/jeanshanchik/KVKRepo/blob/master/Git%20Collaboration%20Files/ForkingvsCloning.md). You now want those changes to be made to the original repository. A pull request is simply an ask to accept your changes to the original repository.

_Tip_: A pull and a pull request are two different commands. A pull is a combination of a fetch and a merge, and a pull request is a an ask to accept YOUR changes.

### Steps

Let's say you're ready to make changes after you've done your forking and cloning, and you're ready to submit a pull request:

1. Navigate to the original repository that you created your fork from.

2. To the right of the branch menu, click **"New pull request"**.

3. On the compare page, click **"Compare across forks"**.

4. Make sure the _base fork_ is switched to the repository that you want to merge your changes into. Also check that the _base branch_ is on the branch you want to merge the changes into.

5. Use the _head fork_ drop-down menu to select your fork, then use the _compare branch_ drop-down menu to select the branch you made your changes in.

6. Now you can enter a title and a description for the pull request. 

7. Finally, you can click **"Create Pull Request"** once your request is ready for review. It will then get sent to the owner of the repository and they will either accept or reject your request.


_Cool Tip: Pull requests have their own discussion forums, so that collaborators can talk about the changes if necessary and align the team._

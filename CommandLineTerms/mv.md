## Move

### What is it?
**mv** - Stands for move or rename. This command is used to move files or directories from one place to another. Directories or single and multiple files can be moved.
### Why do you do it?
One would us\e the *mv* command to move a file into a directory. It can also be used to move a directory elsewhere. If the user wanted to rename a file or directory, they can use the same command to do so.
### How do you do it?
Similar to a *cp* command, the *mv* command can be passed followed by the name of the original file and then the new name for the file. In the following image below, you will see how test1.txt is renamed to test3.txt and then moved into a new directory.

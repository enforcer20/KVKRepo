## Vi

Vi is a command line text editor. Similar to Notepad, it is intended to be used as a plain text editor.

There are two modes in Vi:
    1. Insert (or Input)
        - In Insert modre, you may input content into a file
    2. Edit
        - In Edit mode, you can move around the file, delete, add or do basic text editor functions
        
### Create/Open Files

A file in the command window can be opened with *vi* followed by the name of your file. When you run this command, it opens up your file. If the file does not exist, one will be created for you with the name given.

Once you enter *Vi*, you will see something like the image below.

### Insert/Edit Files in Vi

Once your file is open, the user can press the letter *i* to toggle to the **INSERT** mode. This mode allows the user to insert or edit contents of the file like the image shown below.

After editing your file, you can hit the *ESC* key to exit **INSERT** mode. Saving and Exiting your file is as simple as typing *ZZ* (Note: UpperCase). 
    
If you ever want to preview the contents of your file in the command window without opening the file, you can type "cat (*Insert File Name*). The image below shows an example.

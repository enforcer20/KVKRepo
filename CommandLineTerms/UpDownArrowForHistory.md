## Up & Down Arrow For History

### What is it?
The up and down arrow when used in the terminal allows the user to recall the previous line (down arrow) and the next line (down arrow) for commands used.
### Why do you do it?
One would use this if they wanted to get a previously used command line instead of typing it as the commands are saved as history in the current session
### How do you do it?
One can press the up arrow to browse through previously used commands or down to go to go back.

*For Example*

If a list of commands used were the following:
1. pwd
2. ls
3. cd ..

If the user presses the *up arrow* twice, they would land at the *pwd* command

If the user presses the *down arrow* once, they would land at the *ls* command

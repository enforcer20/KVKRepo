## Git's contribution to helping a company improve productivity and competitiveness

**Git**, an open source project is a widely used modern distributed version control system that has become popular in the past decade. Several software projects rely on Git because of it's many usages that not only improve productivity but also give companies a competitive edge.

1. **Version Control**
Git offers a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository stored in local computers of all developers. Small to large scale projects can generally have multiple developers working parallely. Git's capability to branch provide developers with an isolated environment to make changes to their code. Branching reduces corrupting the production level code that is in master and gives developers their own workspace. This helps a company be more organized and productive. There are many instances where multiple developers working at the same time can rewrite another developer's code and lose considerable progress.
2. **Flexibility**
Project requirements are rarely concrete. Git's version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code in case of any changes. This in turn helps retain a solid customer base but makes the companies easier to rely on.
3. **Security**
Git's security features make it a reliable version control system. All content and changes made in a Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects code and change history against accidental or malicious changes. This ensures a fully traceable history. 
4. **Collaboration**
Git offers a pull request functionality. A pull request is a way for a developer to merge one of their branches into another developers' repository. This makes collaboration much easier and project leads can keep better track of changes. Developers can discuss on an issue that someone might need help with and share code to maintain productivity. 
5. **Community**
Git has a very active community. Open source projects shared by an several developers provide a means to reach out to other experienced developers who can fork their code with the users.
6. **Iterative Process**
The biggest feature Git offers is a faster release cycle. Git's capabilities facilitate an agile workflow where developers share small incremental changes more frequently in forms of sprints. Changes can be pushed down the developement pipeline into production. These small victories help companies succeed competitively with their customers and productively with their developers.
7. **Configuration**
Git is easy to configure. Developers can set up their system to deploy the most recent commit from the developement branch to the test server whenever antyone merges a pull request into it. This allows for automation and peer review, which reduces risk and and increases confidence as you deploy your chanfges into production with certainty.

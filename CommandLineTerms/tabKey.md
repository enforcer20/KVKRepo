## Using the Tab Key to Complete File Paths

### What is it?
The tab key allows the user to autocomplete the names of directories and files while in the command line.
### Why do you do it?
One would use the *tab* key to autocomplete names when trying to change directories for faster traversal to the desired destination.
### How do you do it?
Generally, a user would type the following.

**cd** *(the first letter of the file or directory)*

Once the above has been typed, instead of pressing the *Enter* key, press the tab key to autocomplete the name. The first directory or file that begins with the first letter you typed will be automatically typed into the command line. Please see the image below for an example:

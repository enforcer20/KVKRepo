## Extending a class
Extending a class, also know as Inheritance is when a class uses code constructed within another class. If we think of inheritance in terms of biology, we can think of a child inheriting certain traits from their parent. That is, a child can inherit a parentâ€™s height or eye color. Children also may share the same last name with their parents.

### Advantages of extending a class
Inheritance or extending a class are that:
-  It allows the code to be reused as many times as needed.
-  The base class once defined and once it is compiled, it need not be reworked.
-  Saves time and effort as the main code need not be written again.

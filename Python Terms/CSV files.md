## CSV Files
A CSV file is a Comma Separated Values file. All CSV files are plain text files, can contain numbers and letters only, and structure the data contained within them in a tabular, or table, form.

Files ending in the CSV file extension are generally used to exchange data, usually when there's a large amount, between different applications. Database programs, analytical software, and other applications that store massive amounts of information (like contacts and customer data), usually support the CSV format.

### Opening a CSV file


In order to open the CSV file, we make use of the module called CSV reader which allows us to read the CSV files.

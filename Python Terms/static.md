## Static

### What is Static?
Static methods in Python are extremely similar to python class level methods. The only difference is that a static method is bound to a class, but not an object for that class.

Static exist only in single instance per class and are not instantiated. If a static  is changed in one instance of the class, the change will affect its value in all other instances.

Below is an image of static being created and utilized.

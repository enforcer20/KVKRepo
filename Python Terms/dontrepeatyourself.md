## Dont Repeat Yourself

### What is it?
The "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle is a software developement practice intended at reducing reptition of information in your code. When applied successfully, any modification or change of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change uniformly and kept in sync.

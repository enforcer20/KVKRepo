## Reading Files
The [csv library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) provides functionality to both read from and write to CSV files. Designed to work out of the box with Excel-generated CSV files, it is easily adapted to work with a variety of CSV formats. The csv library contains objects and other code to read, write, and process data from and to CSV files.

### Reading CSV Files With csv
Reading from a CSV file is done using the reader object. The CSV file is opened as a text file with Pythonâ€™s built-in open() function, which returns a file object. This is then passed to the reader, which does the reading of the data.

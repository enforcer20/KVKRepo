## How Python uses Indentation to control Flow

### What is Control Flow?
Control flow in code determines the order in which a code in the program is executed. 

### Indentation
Indentation is one way python uses to determine control flow. Indentation uses the white space in code as a means of declaring the scope of the code. Without indentation, it would be difficult to recognize what code sits within the scope of a function or a class. A given indented block must use a uniform level of indentation. For example: If the first line of an indented block has three leading spaces, all following lines in that block must lead with exactly 3 white spaces. 

The below image shows an example of a block that is INCORRECTLY indented:

## Unit Test

### What is an Unit Test
In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code, sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to determine whether they are fit for use.

## Different types of Unit Testing

Unit Testing is of two types

-  Manual
-  Automated

Unit testing is most commonly automated but may also be performed manually. Software Engineering does not favor one over the other but automation is preferred. A manual approach to unit testing may employ a step-by-step instructional document.

### Test Driven Development (TDD) & Unit Testing

Unit testing in TDD involves an extensive use of testing frameworks. A unit test framework is used in order to create automated unit tests. Unit testing frameworks are not unique to TDD, but they are essential to it. Below we look at some of what TDD brings to the world of unit testing:

Tests are written before the code
Rely heavily on testing frameworks
All classes in the applications are tested
Quick and easy integration is made possible

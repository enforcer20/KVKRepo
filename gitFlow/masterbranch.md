## Master Branch

The Master branch stores official release history of the project or the repository. 
Master branch is for ready-product which can be downloaded on the market by users.

Development and testing will take place on other the other branches such as the release branch or the develop branch but once all the changes have been finalised, it is updated to the master branch.

See [gitFlow](gitFlow.md) to learn more about how branching works in git.

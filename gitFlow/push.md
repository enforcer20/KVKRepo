## Push

The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.

### How to push:

**Syntax:** git push `<remote> <branch>`

Here, we push the specified branch to `<remote>` along with all of the necessary commits and internal objects.

### Example:

```
git push origin master
```

He we are pushing all the changes from the local repository to the master branch in github.

# Learning Git
## Merge

Merging allows you to combine the work from two different branches together. Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. Merging allows us to branch off, develop a new feature, and then combine it back in.

### How to merge 

In order to merge branch1 into branch2, branch2 must be selected (This can be done using checkout). We use the command:

```
git merge branch1
```

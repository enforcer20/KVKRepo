# Learning Git
## Branch
Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line. Branches in Git are incredibly lightweight as well. They are simply pointers to a specific commit -- nothing more
## How branching works

###  Creating a new branch

In order to create a new branch, we use the command:
```
git branch "branch name"
```

### Example

We want to create a new branch called `newImage` 


we use the command 
```
git branch newImage 
```



A new branch called newImage has been created.
